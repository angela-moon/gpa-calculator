# GPA Calculator
In celebration of my finishing another school year, I coded a GPA Calculator (!) using our school's grading system because they haven't 
updated Focus yet D:

### Description
It first asks for how many classes you're taking. Using that information it shows entry boxes for each course you are taking. There is a dropdown menu for whether it is a Standard course or an Honors/AP course.
After the enter grades button is hit, it adds the corresponding GPA to 
a list of your GPAs for each class. 

Once it's done with asking for your grade in each class, it will average the values in the list of GPAs and will output your average GPA
to the tenth place.

There are two drafts of the GUI code at the moment because one was too messy. The GUI is also broken at the moment, but the script works fine.
