# GPA Calculator
In celebration of my finishing another school year, I coded a GPA Calculator (!) using our school's grading system because they haven't 
updated Focus yet D:  
It's very crude; I haven't learned the fancy design stuff yet. 

### Description
Basically, it first asks for how many classes you're taking. It then asks whether that class is a standard class or an honors/AP class. 
After recieving this input, it asks what grade you recieved and depending on the level of the course, it adds the corresponding GPA to 
a list of your GPAs for each class. 

Once it's done with asking for your grade in each class, it will average the values in the list of GPAs and will output your average GPA
to the tenth place.
